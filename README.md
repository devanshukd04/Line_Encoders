# Line_Encoders
It is a program written in Java to plot digital signals into their analog forms based on various Encoding techniques UniPolar, Polar NRZ-L, Manchester and Differential Manchester. Netbeans has been used as an IDE to develop the application.

# Line Encoding
Line Encoding is needed to convert digital Signals into Analog Signals.
Different types of line encoding forms are:
# 1.)	Unipolar
Unipolar Encoding is a line code.
When the signals travels only in one direction of axis, it is unipolar line encoding.
Here, positive signal represents a binary 1 and zero signals indicates a binary 0.
It is the simplest line code. 
# 2.)	Polar NRZ-L
When the signals travels in both direction it is called a polar encoding.
In Polar NRZ-l, level of voltage determines the value of bit.
Here, positive signal represents a binary 0 and negative signals indicates a binary 1.
# 3.)	Polar NRZ-I
In polar NRZ-I, the change or lack of change in the level of voltage determines the value of bit.
Here, change in voltage represents a binary 1 and no change in level of voltage represents a binary 1.
# 4.)	Manchester
Manchester encoding is a combination of the RZ (transition at the middle of the bit) and NRZ-L schemes. The duration of the bit is divided into two halves. The voltage remains at one level during the first half and moves to the other level in the second half. The transition at the middle of the bit provides synchronization.
# 5.)	Differential Manchester
Differential Manchester is somewhat combination of the RZ and NRZ-l schemes.
There is always a transition at the middle of the bit, but the bit values are determined at the beginning of the bit. If the next bit is 0, there is a transition, if the next bit is 1, there is no transition.
